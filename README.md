# The my-k8s-scheduler

The my-k8s-scheduler is a k8s service that I have implemented to finish the scheduiling part to prepare for the CKA (AKA: Certified Kubernetes Admin) with implementing my own k8s scheduler. It is consisted of:

  - The my-k8s-scheduler SA (aka: ServiceAccount).
  - The my-k8s-scheduler clusterRole.
  - The my-k8s-scheduler clusterRoleBinding.
  - The Dockerfile for building the image and use it later in the deployment.


You can also:
  - Make a pull request with any new updates you would want to add to the service.
